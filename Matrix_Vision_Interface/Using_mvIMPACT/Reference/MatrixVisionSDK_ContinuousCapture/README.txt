Tests of mvIMPACT Python library (Matrix Vision mvIMPACT Acquire SDK Python).
These are all modified versions of the ContinuousCapture.py script from the Matrix Vision Python SDK website.
For the ContinuousCapture.py script, see:
https://www.matrix-vision.com/manuals/SDK_PYTHON/index.html
https://www.matrix-vision.com/manuals/SDK_PYTHON/ContinuousCapture_8py-example.html

IMPORTANT NOTE: This code does not work if we have an older version of mvIMPACT Acquire installed
(e.g. version 2.35.0). Probably Matrix Vision changed their mvIMPACT library since then.
