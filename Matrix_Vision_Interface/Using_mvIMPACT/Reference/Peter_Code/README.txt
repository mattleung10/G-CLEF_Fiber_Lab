Code from Peter Doherty to acquire images from a Matrix Vision mvBlueCOUGAR-X102kG camera,
using the mvIMPACT Python library.

Note that this code was written for an older version of mvIMPACT Acquire (2.35.0), from 2019.
Hence, some features do not work when using more updated versions of the Matrix Vision SDK.
