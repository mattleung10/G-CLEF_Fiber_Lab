Old versions of the alpha shapes analysis code.
All of the scripts in this directory work, but are just older versions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT EACH SCRIPT DOES:

alpha_shape_analysis.py
This script contains driver code for functions from alpha_shape_id_roi.py.
Use this script on a directory of images to find the alpha shape of the fiber face in each image.

alpha_shape_analysis_darks.py
Similar to alpha_shape_analysis.py, but allows for subtraction of dark and bias frames.

alpha_shape_analysis_darks_V2.py
Similar to alpha_shape_analysis_darks.py, but has uncertainty calculation.
